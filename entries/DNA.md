# DNA

**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is a molecule that contains the biological instructions that make each species unique. DNA, along with the instructions it contains, is passed from adult organisms to their offspring during reproduction.

## Structure

DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. These building blocks are made of three parts:
- A phosphate group
- A sugar group
- A nitrogen base

There are four types of nitrogen bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the DNA’s instructions.

## Function

DNA sequences must be converted into messages that can be used to produce proteins. This process is called **gene expression** and involves two main steps: **transcription** and **translation**.

## Discovery

DNA was first identified in the late 1860s by Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher. Its double-helix structure was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, based on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins.

## Applications

DNA analysis is widely used in medicine, forensic science, agriculture, and ancestry research. Techniques like CRISPR have enabled scientists to edit genes with high precision.
