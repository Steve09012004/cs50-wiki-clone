# Photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis** is a process used by plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. This energy is stored in glucose molecules, which are used to fuel the organism's activities.

## The Process

Photosynthesis occurs mainly in the leaves of plants and involves two stages:

1. **Light-dependent reactions**: Convert solar energy into ATP and NADPH
2. **Calvin cycle (light-independent)**: Uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO₂ into glucose

## Chemical Equation

6 CO₂ + 6 H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6 O₂

## Importance

- Produces oxygen as a by-product
- Provides energy for nearly all living organisms
- Regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide levels

## Evolution

Photosynthesis is believed to have evolved over 3 billion years ago, enabling the development of more complex life forms.

## Fun Fact

Only about 1% of the sunlight that reaches Earth is used for photosynthesis, yet it powers nearly all ecosystems.
